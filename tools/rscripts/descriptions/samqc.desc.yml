# This file contains descriptions for the blatCoupleR program.
program_short_description : "R-based nucleotide sequence QC filter for paired-end sequences aligned and in a sorted BAM format."

# The following are descriptions of options.
bam : "Sorted BAM file with alignment information to the reference genome."
bai : "BAM index file associated with previous argument."
uniqOutput : "Output file for unique alignments. File types supported: .rds, .RData, .csv, and .tsv"
condSites : "Output file for condensed sites, based on anchor alignments. Read counts and unique alignment length counts are reported for each unique site. Same file types supported as uniqOutput."
chimeras : "Output file for chimeric alignments. File type '.rds' only."
multihits : "Output file for multihit alignments. File type '.rds' only."
stat : "File name to be written in output directory of read couts for each sample. CSV file format. ie. test.stat.csv."
refGenome : "Reference genome, needs to be installed through BSgenome (BioConductor)."
maxAlignStart : "Maximum allowable distance from the start of the sequence to keep the alignment. Default = 5."
minPercentIdentity : "Minimal global (whole sequence) percent identity required to keep alignment. Default = 95 (0-100)."
minTempLength : "Minimum value for paired template length to consider. Default = 30 (bps)."
maxTempLength : "Maximum value for paired template length to consider. Default = 2500 (bps)."
keepAltChr : "By default, blatCoupleR will remove alignments from psl files aligning to alternative chromosome, unknown, and random sequences, ex. chr7_*_alt. Using this option will keep these alignments, which may increase multihit outputs."
readNamePattern : "Regular expression for pattern matching read names. Should not contain R1/R2/I1/I2 specific components. Default is [\\w:-]+"
saveImage : "Output file name for saved image. Include '.RData'. ie. debug.RData"
