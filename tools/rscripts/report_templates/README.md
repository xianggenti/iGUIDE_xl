# Report Templates
This directory contains Rmd file(s) that act as templates for iGUIDE reports.

Feel free to create custom templates by modifying the standard iGUIDE_report_template.Rmd.

The standard template is used by default to generate the report, but custom templates can be included by running 'iguide report ... --template <path/to/custom.template.Rmd>'.
