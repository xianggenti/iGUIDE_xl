Description: 
    iGUIDE is a pipeline for identifying double strand breaks from genomic DNA
    using a small DNA oligo based marker method. Sequences obtained by applying
    the iGUIDE protocol to a treated sample mark out such double strand breaks.
    It is therefore up to informatic analysis to discern the signal for nuclease
    specific double strand breaks from the noise of naturally occurring double
    strand breaks. This r-package carries many support functions for this 
    analysis.
